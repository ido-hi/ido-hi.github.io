After watching a couple of YouTube videos, I had the knowledge to start my own eBay store.\\n\\nAt that point I had a **brand-new account** with **0 feedbacks**, **0 customers**, and just listed my **first item** \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n# The first sell\\nAt the beginning I was very skeptical about it.\\n\\nWhy would someone buy the stuff from me in a more expensive price rather than buy it from my supplier just like I do?\\n\\nBut after 1 day that my listing was up, **my first item had sold!**\\n\\nI sold it for **$29.99** and made a profit of $0.58, yes **only 58 cents profit**, but it was enough for me to see the potential. \\n\\nI was super excited about it, and it gave me motivation to keep on going. Another thought that kept me motivated was to thinking about few years from now, and how much money I could possibly make if I will stay consistent.\\n\\n# Progress\\nI\'ve been dropshipping for the last 2 weeks now, and what I\'ve learned is that all of the YouTubers that promiss you quick and easy money, are wrong...\\n\\nIn **2 weeks** I\'ve sold **3 items** in total revenue of around **$200**, and not very high precentage profit.\\n\\nI\'ve also learned that one of the biggest problems about eBay dropshipping is the seller limits.  \\nEvery month you have only so many items you can list or sell, and they are very restricting (you start with 3 items and $200).  \\nGetting the seller limits up is difficult because eBay won\'t allow you to do that very often (usually once a month), but with patient and consistency, once you get enough seller limits, you could make a lot of money.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nDropshipping takes **time** and **effort**.\\n\\nYou can\'t expect quick results without putting the time and work needed.\\n\\nBut once you have the patient and the consistency, and you keep on going, I believe that you can achive **anything you want.**\\n\\nHere is a link to [my eBay store](https://www.ebay.com/usr/itsidohirsh), and I will update you here along the way.\\n\\nso till next time, see ya \ud83d\ude00"},{"id":"/2022/05/28/berlin","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/05/28/berlin","editUrl":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh/itsidohirsh.github.io/tree/master/blog/2022-05-28-berlin.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-28-berlin.md","title":"Berlin","description":"8 day trip with my best friend to Berlin","date":"2022-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 28, 2022","tags":[{"label":"travel","permalink":"/blog/tags/travel"}],"readingTime":15.865,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ido Hirsh","title":"Founder","url":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh","imageURL":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh.png","key":"ido"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Berlin","description":"8 day trip with my best friend to Berlin","authors":"ido","tags":["travel"],"keywords":["travel","city","Berlin","Germany"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Dropshipping","permalink":"/blog/2022/06/13/dropshipping"},"nextItem":{"title":"It shouldn\'t have taken so long...","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/07/docusaurus"}},"content":"8 day trip to Berlin with my best friend \ud83c\udf7a\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn 3 weeks or so I\'ll start my army service. Before it starts, me and my best friend **Omri** decided to go on a trip together.\\n\\nOur trip was 8 days long, 20 - 28 of May, and we chose Berlin mainly because we wanted to travel in the day, and party at night \ud83d\ude09\\n\\nWe planned the trip a month ahead, which hellped us know exactly what to do in any given moment, and what are the best places to visit. What are the best burger restaurants, bars, clubs, and atractions.\\n\\nI documented our trip at the end of each day, and now I\'ll share it with you!\\n\\n### Friday, 20/05\\nThe first day of the trip \ud83d\ude01\\n\\nWe first arrived at Terminal 1 as it was written on the internet, but of course the flight was in Terminal 3\u2026 \ud83d\ude43\\n\\nAnyway after we got through the rest of the stuff, and of course we got through duty free, we got on the plane.\\n\\nOf course after an hour delay and a bit before takeoff, the flight attendant informed us that the plane could not take off because there is too much weight up front and some need to move to the last rows (\ud83d\ude33), so of course I (Ido) sitting next to mom with baby, jumped at the chance and Omri with me.\\n\\nWe landed in Berlin!\\n\\nAfter a successful landing we took a taxi to the hotel, and after check in straight away we went to eat sausage at **Curry36** which was great!  \\nI write this at 3:00 at night (4:00 in Israel) so we are tired but happy \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude34\\n\\n### Saturday, 21/05\\nWe got up and went out to look for breakfast.  \\nWe ended up buying breads, sausages, cheeses, delicacies and orange juice from one of the supermarkets, and took them to eat at the **Park am Gleisdreieck** near the hotel area (we forgot to bring glasses so no orange juice for us\u2026 \ud83d\ude43)\\n\\nAfter breakfast we set off in the direction of the **City Hall**, from where the tour of the city of Berlin will begin. It turns out there is more than one City Hall in the city, so of course we went to the wrong one and missed the tour. We were a bit taken aback but not terrible, so we got to different parts of the city that we would not have reached without this mistake :)\\n\\nAfter coming to terms with the mistake, we proceeded to the most popular street in Berlin, **Unter der Linden**. There we saw many more tourists and impressive buildings like restored churches, auditoriums and the **Brandburg Gate**. Arriving at the famous gate, Brandburg, it started to rain a bit as it did intermittently during the day, but very quickly stopped and the sun went back to the sky.\\n\\nWe were a little hungry so we went to eat at **Burgermeister**, an excellent burger, enjoyed it very much \ud83d\ude0b\\n\\nAt this point we had already walked almost 20 kilometers so we needed a break, we decided to go to the park to lie on the grass with sun on our faces. There we were approached by some German guys who did not really know English\u2026 but it was fun to talk a little with locals, and in retrospect we were surprised that we were not left to talk a little more with guys our age who know the city.\\n\\nWe continued to walk a little further down the boulevard and then returned for a light rest at the hotel where we saw the **German Cup final** Leipzig against Freiburg where Leipzig won (on penalties). We went out to the party, but when we arrived we realized that there were only adults there and that it was not for us, but the rest of the parties were too far away and it was already too late to get the best out of it. So we went to eat at McDonald\'s where we planned the next day for details in order to take full advantage of it.\\n\\nIn total we walked almost 30 miles today and now 2:30 at night, so we go to sleep \ud83d\ude34\\n\\n### Sunday, 22/05\\nWe got up and left for the **Free Tour Berlin**. On the way we stopped at a small Spanish shop and ate brisket with sausage and coffee nearby.\\n\\nThe tour was about 3 hours, where we learned a lot about the history of Berlin in particular and Germany in general. We have seen all sorts of historic buildings; Sculptures with surprising meanings; And monuments in memory of the terrible history of Germany, and especially the Holocaust.\\n\\nWe finished the tour at the Brandenburg Gate, and from there we took a train to **Block House**, a highly recommended meat restaurant, and there is something for. The food was excellent and reasonably priced.\\n\\nWe then returned for a short rest at the hotel before heading out for the **Berlin Pub Crawl**, a tour of bars, pubs and clubs in the city.\\n\\nThe tour started at 21:30 with a funny guide who was not really connected \ud83d\ude43 and these were us and another bunch of 13 boys and girls from Scotland. The group was not really nice to us especially after we told them we were Israelis, that was not a very pleasant experience. They did not disturb us or anything, but neither did they attach us to them.\\n\\nIn any case, the tour consisted of three bars and then a club, in each bar 50 minutes (supposedly\u2026).\\n\\nThe first bar was called **Bellishi\u2019s** and it was great, where we met **Roman**, a cool 18 year old Mexican guy we sat with for the first 50 minutes of the tour.\\n\\nThen we continued to the second bar, I (Ido) do not remember his name and he was not a very good bar, but there we met **Ben**, a 28-year-old Frenchman who is also on vacation in Berlin. We talked with him and he continued with us to the next bar as well.\\n\\nWe continued to the third bar, **Kek** bar. The bar was small and packed with people but the atmosphere was great. After a while came to me **Yuri**, a 29-year-old Korean who gave me very nice compliments and wanted us to talk. After which she and her friends (all working at Bellishi\u2019s) came with us to the club. Very cool people, funny, and nice.\\n\\nAfter finishing at the bar, we continued to the **Matrix** club. The club is open 365 days a year and is one of the most recognized and recommended clubs in Berlin. We arrived on a Sunday of the week so the club was full but not blown up to 0 place which was great. Together with the whole company we met at Kek, we celebrated and enjoyed until 5 in the morning (which would turn out to be a mistake the day after\u2026 \ud83e\udd73).\\n\\nIn short even though we were not exactly with the group of the pub crawl we got the best out of it. We met new people and enjoyed every moment \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n### Monday, 23/05\\nAs I mentioned the day before, we went to bed at 5:30 in the morning that by this time the sun was already shining in Berlin, so we had to sleep. We got up at 12:45 in the afternoon, which shortened the rest of the day for us.\\n\\nFirst we did the **Alternative Tour Berlin**, a tour that shows another side of Berlin. Shows the artistic and cultural side, rather than the historical side (although it is difficult to separate them completely).\\n\\nThe tour lasted about 3 hours where we saw street art, graffiti and heard funny and sad stories about the history that caused the culture to develop.\\nWe ended the tour at the **East side gallery**, the largest foreign gallery in the world, which is the gallery on the **Berlin Wall**. There we saw all the famous and non-famous paintings of the wall, and what the meaning behind each one is.\\n\\nThe whole tour was very interesting and taught us a lot about the culture and art of Berlin, and how it developed near its terrible history.\\n\\nThe weather was great, sunny but not too hot, so after the tour we sat in a nearby park, drank beer and got some vitamin D. Omri was hungry, so we stopped to eat at Five guys and from there we started walking towards the hotel but it was a walk of more than an hour so at the end we took a train.\\n\\nAfter a rest of about an hour at the hotel, we went out to eat. We ate at a restaurant right in front of our hotel called **Miromi**, an excellent Asian restaurant that in my eyes does not fall short of the Giraffe.\\n\\nWe wanted to go to bed early but still wanted to go out to some bar, so we arranged with Roman at Bellishi\'s to sit down for a beer. There we also met the rest of the company we knew at Kek, who work there, and it was a fun evening.\\n\\nWe returned to the hotel around 2:00 and went to sleep \ud83d\ude34\\n\\n### Tusday, 24/05\\nWe got up at 10, I\'m a little early, relatively early to yesterday \ud83d\ude43 and went out to eat breakfast. We bought breads, sausages and tomatoes and sat down to eat breakfast on a bench near the park.\\n\\nThen we went to **Aqua Dom**, the sea world in Berlin. There we saw all kinds of very cool underwater fish and animals some of which we had not seen before. Was very interesting and fun but in our opinion it is a little Overrated attraction.\\n\\nAfter the Aqua Dom we went to the **TV Tower of Berlin**. The TV tower reaches a peak of about 300 meters, and gives a different and very impressive way of looking at Berlin. There is also a restaurant at the top of the tower where we ate some starters, where the floor revolves and during the meal you can see the whole of Berlin.\\n\\nWe were not satisfied with the first courses in the tower so we went to eat small at McDonald\'s and from there we went back to the hotel.\\n\\nIn the evening we went out to do a tour of the city, we went to see the **Brandenburg Gate**, we ate, we went back to the hotel and now we go to sleep \ud83e\udd71\\n\\n### Wednesday, 25/05\\nFor breakfast we bought breads and sausages from the supermarket and sat down to eat in the park (yes we have done this several times already but it\'s fun what the problem is \ud83e\udd28).\\n\\nAfter breakfast we headed towards the **Spree River**. We went on a cruise that lasted about an hour along the river while giving detailed explanations of the various parts, buildings and cups we passed next to them in the city (to our surprise, the explanations could also be heard in Hebrew!). To me the cruise was a great experience that gave us another and different look at the city.\\n\\nAfter the cruise we went to the **Berlin Zoo**. Wow, one of the big and diverse zoos that I (Ido) personally have been to. We have seen animals of all kinds and species and from all the continents and different countries around the world. We were there for more than 3 hours and saw almost the entire zoo (except the giraffe\u2026 \ud83e\udd92). The main animals we had the most fun seeing were first of all the seals, which were very cute and funny; Secondly the panda bear, one of the cute animals I got to see and glad we got to see them so up close; And in addition the chimpanzees, who amazed us to see how similar they are to us both in appearance and in how they behave separately and with each other.\\n\\nTime passed very quickly at the zoo (time passes quickly when you have fun\u2026) and it was already 18:30 and we had not eaten anything since the sausage sandwich in the morning. We were very hungry. How when we left the zoo we saw a branch of Curry36 and that\'s exactly what suited us, it was great \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\\n\\nAfter we finished eating we went to the **Monkey bar**. A bar located on the 10th floor of the building in front of the zoo, overlooking its large monkey cage (hence the name). We ordered two drinks and sat down to drink them in front of the spectacular view that can be seen at this height. It was a lot of fun there \ud83c\udf7b\\n\\nAfter five days we are together 24/7, not everything is perfect and a little argument started between us. I went in to take a shower and when I left I realized that it was really stupid and that we should talk about it so that it would not ruin the rest of the trip for us, Omri wanted time alone and did not want to talk so much so everyone went to work. We wanted to go out to a club or a bar or something today but I think it will not happen today. Hopefully tomorrow will be different so we can take advantage of the time we have left in Berlin and not end up with such a disgusting feeling.\\n\\n### Thursday, 26/05\\nA bit of a bad start to the day after yesterday. We started with breakfast in a cafe near the hotel and from there we continued to the **Berlin Museum of Technology**.\\n\\nThe museum was relatively large but not exactly an interactive technology museum as described on the various sites. he. What\'s more a historical museum of old technology, like planes, ships, jewelry making, trains, etc.? Overall it was cool but we expected more.\\n\\nWe then went to eat. We ate at **Vapiano** restaurant, an Italian restaurant that was cute (not like Italy\u2026 \ud83d\ude43).\\n\\nNext to the restaurant we went to the **Futurium Museum**, a museum that presents possible scenarios for the future, and shows solutions for sustainable energy sources. The museum was very cool and interactive, and showed us how much power technology has. I personally really liked the experience.\\n\\nThe museum is next to the Spree River, so after we finished at the museum we took 2 glasses of beer and sat on the river bank. It\'s just like a \'beach\' where a lot of people sit and look at the landscape of Berlin. Was very cool.\\n\\nNow we were already hungry so we went to look for the recommended restaurant **Lili burger**, every site we read recommended a rise. We started driving there but unfortunately there is another place called Lili and it is at the other end of town so we just drove half an hour to another place. After realizing the mistake we drove to the right place, but when we arrived the place was not where it was supposed to be. We searched the nearby streets but without success. At the end we asked a local couple and he told us that they closed the place some time ago and that it no longer exists. Bummer. But the couple directed us to another burger restaurant that is close to a place called **Brgrs Brgrs**. The burger was nice, not amazing, but enjoyed nonetheless.\\n\\nAfter eating we drove to a very cool bar called **Ice bar**. The whole bar is made of ice (also the glasses) and the temperature is 20 degrees (when we left the bar we could not feel some of the fingers \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude01). The place is very cool and there is a great deal of entry and 3 drinks each.\\n\\nAfter the bar we arranged to go out with the guys we met a few days ago at the Kek bar. We went to the bar with them and what we did not know was that they were going to a gay bar. Ummm, yes. The place was not exactly for us, and the experience was not that pleasant, so we tried to get out of there as quickly as possible without offending the rest. One of the friends wanted to get us out of there because he saw we were not having so much fun, and take us to a party. But there was a holiday here that no one understood what it was, and because of it all the parties were closed.\\n\\nIn short, an interesting evening. We were at an ice bar, we accidentally got to a gay bar and in the end we did not go to the party as we wanted. But\u2026 experiences\u2026\\n\\nWe went back to the hotel and went to bed around 3:00, in order to try to get up tomorrow as early as possible for the last day \ud83e\udd7a\\n\\n### Friday, 27/05 + Saturday, 28/05\\nLast day for a trip \ud83e\udd7a\\n\\nWe got up late\u2026 \ud83e\udd71\ud83d\ude10 and left the hotel at 11:30.\\n\\nWe stopped at the supermarket to buy breakfast, and from there we drove to the **Illusions Museum**, which was finally closed so we did not enter\u2026\\n\\nExcept for the museum we wanted to do, this day was for shopping for clothes and gifts for friends and family.\\n\\nWe wandered around the different parts of the city in search of shops of the things we wanted. We went through Decathlon where we played Ping-Pong for almost an hour, at Vans store where Omri bought hats, at the C&A store where Omri bought some shirts and I bought a cool hat. In short mostly we went around for shopping that day.\\n\\nFor lunch we drove to the recommended hamburger restaurant **The bird**. One of the most delicious burgers we have ever eaten! And along with a glass of beer everything was just great \ud83c\udf7b\\n\\nThe we were full and it made us tired, and because we also had a flight on which we left the hotel at 3:00 in the morning, we went back to the hotel to pack up and go to bed.\\n\\nWe got to the hotel, packed up, showered, and now go to bed until we get up for the flight. I will update when we get revenge \ud83d\ude43\\n\\nWe got up at 3:15 and at 3:30 we were picked up by a taxi from the hotel. We arrived at the airport and were looking for something to eat, we were looking for McDonald\'s. Unfortunately neither McDonalds nor shoes, at the whole airport there was a single cafe with a half hour queue. But we were too hungry not to eat so we bought two sandwiches, coffee, chocolate and a croissant. Was reasonable. We then went to the gate of our flight, which was a 40 minute walk from us (\ud83e\udd75).\\n\\nWe arrived at the gate, got on the plane and now on our way to Israel \ud83d\ude01\u2708\ufe0f"},{"id":"/2022/05/07/docusaurus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/05/07/docusaurus","editUrl":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh/itsidohirsh.github.io/tree/master/blog/2022-05-07-docusaurus.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-07-docusaurus.md","title":"It shouldn\'t have taken so long...","description":"Building my GitHub Pages website using docusaurus.","date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"software","permalink":"/blog/tags/software"},{"label":"technology","permalink":"/blog/tags/technology"}],"readingTime":1.495,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ido Hirsh","title":"Founder","url":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh","imageURL":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh.png","key":"ido"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"It shouldn\'t have taken so long...","description":"Building my GitHub Pages website using docusaurus.","authors":"ido","tags":["software","technology"],"keywords":["docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Berlin","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/28/berlin"},"nextItem":{"title":"The beginning","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/06/first-post"}},"content":"Building my GitHub Pages website using **Docusaurus** \ud83d\ude2b\ud83e\udd14\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nJust finished building my website using a tool called Docusaurus.  \\nDocusaurus is a tool designed to build static websites in just *5 minutes*,\\nbut my experience was a little bit different...\\n\\nFollowing the setup steps on the [website](https://docusaurus.io/) was a pretty good and easy to understand experience, and getting my website to work locally was an easy job.  \\nBut deploying my website to GitHub was a little frustrating.\\n\\n\\n## The struggle\\n\\nI wanted to host my website on the basic GitHub Pages URL of the form `https://username.github.io`, but couldn\'t manage to do that very easily.
