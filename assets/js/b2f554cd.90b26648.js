Every documentation I found only explained how to host the website using a URL of the form `https://username.github.io/repo`.\\n\\n\\n## The solution\\n\\nIn the end I found a simple solution. Just follow the next config and deploy steps.\\n\\n### Config\\n\\n1. Create a repo of the form `username.github.io` in GitHub. Only this repo name allows hosting URLs of the form  `https://username.github.io`.\\n\\n1. Create a new Docusaurus project:\\n    - `npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic`\\n\\n1. In `docusaurus.config.js` modify (or add if doesn\'t appear):\\n    - `url` field to `\'https://username.github.io\'`\\n    - `baseUrl` field to `\'/\'`\\n    - `organizationName` field to `\'username\'`\\n    - `projectName` field to `\'username.github.io\'`\\n    - `deployBranch` field to `\'gh-pages\'`\\n    - `trailingSlash` field to `false`\\n\\n### Deploy\\nThe last step is to deploy to github, simply run:\\n- Bash: `GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy`\\n- Powershell: `cmd /C \'set \\"GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>\\" && yarn deploy\'`\\n- CMD: `cmd /C \\"set \\"GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>\\" && yarn deploy\\"`\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nTo conclude, the experience wasn\'t that bad, but it shouldn\'t have taken so long.\\n\\nHope I helped you if you had the same problem, and if you want me to write on other **Docusaurus** related questions / problems let me know.\\n\\nSee ya \ud83d\ude00"},{"id":"/2022/05/06/first-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/05/06/first-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh/itsidohirsh.github.io/tree/master/blog/2022-05-06-first-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-06-first-post.md","title":"The beginning","description":"First blog post!","date":"2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 6, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":0.205,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ido Hirsh","title":"Founder","url":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh","imageURL":"https://github.com/itsidohirsh.png","key":"ido"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"The beginning","description":"First blog post!","authors":"ido"},"prevItem":{"title":"It shouldn\'t have taken so long...","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/07/docusaurus"}},"content":"> *\\"You have to be odd to be number one\\"* - **Dr. Seuss**\\n\\nHi, I\'m very excited to write my first blog post!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nJust finished setting up my website, and going to start writing more posts.\\n\\nSee ya!"}]}')}}]);
