        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>8 day trip with my best friend to Berlin 🍺🌎😀</p><p>In 3 weeks or so I'll start my army service. Before it starts, me and my best friend <strong>Omri</strong> decided to go on a trip together.</p><p>Our trip was 8 days long, 20 - 28 of May, and we chose Berlin mainly because we wanted to travel in the day, and party at night 😉</p><p>We planned the trip a month ahead, which hellped us know exactly what to do in any given moment, and what are the best places to visit. What are the best burger restaurants, bars, clubs, and atractions.</p><p>I documented our trip at the end of each day, and now I'll share it with you!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="friday-2005">Friday, 20/05<a class="hash-link" href="#friday-2005" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first day of the trip 😁</p><p>We first arrived at Terminal 1 as it was written on the internet, but of course the flight was in Terminal 3… 🙃</p><p>Anyway after we got through the rest of the stuff, and of course we got through duty free, we got on the plane.</p><p>Of course after an hour delay and a bit before takeoff, the flight attendant informed us that the plane could not take off because there is too much weight up front and some need to move to the last rows (😳), so of course I (Ido) sitting next to mom with baby, jumped at the chance and Omri with me.</p><p>We landed in Berlin!</p><p>After a successful landing we took a taxi to the hotel, and after check in straight away we went to eat sausage at <strong>Curry36</strong> which was great!<br>
<!-- -->I write this at 3:00 at night (4:00 in Israel) so we are tired but happy 😄😴</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="saturday-2105">Saturday, 21/05<a class="hash-link" href="#saturday-2105" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We got up and went out to look for breakfast.<br>
<!-- -->We ended up buying breads, sausages, cheeses, delicacies and orange juice from one of the supermarkets, and took them to eat at the <strong>Park am Gleisdreieck</strong> near the hotel area (we forgot to bring glasses so no orange juice for us… 🙃)</p><p>After breakfast we set off in the direction of the <strong>City Hall</strong>, from where the tour of the city of Berlin will begin. It turns out there is more than one City Hall in the city, so of course we went to the wrong one and missed the tour. We were a bit taken aback but not terrible, so we got to different parts of the city that we would not have reached without this mistake :)</p><p>After coming to terms with the mistake, we proceeded to the most popular street in Berlin, <strong>Unter der Linden</strong>. There we saw many more tourists and impressive buildings like restored churches, auditoriums and the <strong>Brandburg Gate</strong>. Arriving at the famous gate, Brandburg, it started to rain a bit as it did intermittently during the day, but very quickly stopped and the sun went back to the sky.</p><p>We were a little hungry so we went to eat at <strong>Burgermeister</strong>, an excellent burger, enjoyed it very much 😋</p><p>At this point we had already walked almost 20 kilometers so we needed a break, we decided to go to the park to lie on the grass with sun on our faces. There we were approached by some German guys who did not really know English… but it was fun to talk a little with locals, and in retrospect we were surprised that we were not left to talk a little more with guys our age who know the city.</p><p>We continued to walk a little further down the boulevard and then returned for a light rest at the hotel where we saw the <strong>German Cup final</strong> Leipzig against Freiburg where Leipzig won (on penalties). We went out to the party, but when we arrived we realized that there were only adults there and that it was not for us, but the rest of the parties were too far away and it was already too late to get the best out of it. So we went to eat at McDonald's where we planned the next day for details in order to take full advantage of it.</p><p>In total we walked almost 30 miles today and now 2:30 at night, so we go to sleep 😴</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="sunday-2205">Sunday, 22/05<a class="hash-link" href="#sunday-2205" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We got up and left for the <strong>Free Tour Berlin</strong>. On the way we stopped at a small Spanish shop and ate brisket with sausage and coffee nearby.</p><p>The tour was about 3 hours, where we learned a lot about the history of Berlin in particular and Germany in general. We have seen all sorts of historic buildings; Sculptures with surprising meanings; And monuments in memory of the terrible history of Germany, and especially the Holocaust.</p><p>We finished the tour at the Brandenburg Gate, and from there we took a train to <strong>Block House</strong>, a highly recommended meat restaurant, and there is something for. The food was excellent and reasonably priced.</p><p>We then returned for a short rest at the hotel before heading out for the <strong>Berlin Pub Crawl</strong>, a tour of bars, pubs and clubs in the city.</p><p>The tour started at 21:30 with a funny guide who was not really connected 🙃 and these were us and another bunch of 13 boys and girls from Scotland. The group was not really nice to us especially after we told them we were Israelis, that was not a very pleasant experience. They did not disturb us or anything, but neither did they attach us to them.</p><p>In any case, the tour consisted of three bars and then a club, in each bar 50 minutes (supposedly…).</p><p>The first bar was called <strong>Bellishi’s</strong> and it was great, where we met <strong>Roman</strong>, a cool 18 year old Mexican guy we sat with for the first 50 minutes of the tour.</p><p>Then we continued to the second bar, I (Ido) do not remember his name and he was not a very good bar, but there we met <strong>Ben</strong>, a 28-year-old Frenchman who is also on vacation in Berlin. We talked with him and he continued with us to the next bar as well.</p><p>We continued to the third bar, <strong>Kek</strong> bar. The bar was small and packed with people but the atmosphere was great. After a while came to me <strong>Yuri</strong>, a 29-year-old Korean who gave me very nice compliments and wanted us to talk. After which she and her friends (all working at Bellishi’s) came with us to the club. Very cool people, funny, and nice.</p><p>After finishing at the bar, we continued to the <strong>Matrix</strong> club. The club is open 365 days a year and is one of the most recognized and recommended clubs in Berlin. We arrived on a Sunday of the week so the club was full but not blown up to 0 place which was great. Together with the whole company we met at Kek, we celebrated and enjoyed until 5 in the morning (which would turn out to be a mistake the day after… 🥳).</p><p>In short even though we were not exactly with the group of the pub crawl we got the best out of it. We met new people and enjoyed every moment 😁</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="monday-2305">Monday, 23/05<a class="hash-link" href="#monday-2305" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As I mentioned the day before, we went to bed at 5:30 in the morning that by this time the sun was already shining in Berlin, so we had to sleep. We got up at 12:45 in the afternoon, which shortened the rest of the day for us.</p><p>First we did the <strong>Alternative Tour Berlin</strong>, a tour that shows another side of Berlin. Shows the artistic and cultural side, rather than the historical side (although it is difficult to separate them completely).</p><p>The tour lasted about 3 hours where we saw street art, graffiti and heard funny and sad stories about the history that caused the culture to develop.
We ended the tour at the <strong>East side gallery</strong>, the largest foreign gallery in the world, which is the gallery on the <strong>Berlin Wall</strong>. There we saw all the famous and non-famous paintings of the wall, and what the meaning behind each one is.</p><p>The whole tour was very interesting and taught us a lot about the culture and art of Berlin, and how it developed near its terrible history.</p><p>The weather was great, sunny but not too hot, so after the tour we sat in a nearby park, drank beer and got some vitamin D. Omri was hungry, so we stopped to eat at Five guys and from there we started walking towards the hotel but it was a walk of more than an hour so at the end we took a train.</p><p>After a rest of about an hour at the hotel, we went out to eat. We ate at a restaurant right in front of our hotel called <strong>Miromi</strong>, an excellent Asian restaurant that in my eyes does not fall short of the Giraffe.</p><p>We wanted to go to bed early but still wanted to go out to some bar, so we arranged with Roman at Bellishi's to sit down for a beer. There we also met the rest of the company we knew at Kek, who work there, and it was a fun evening.</p><p>We returned to the hotel around 2:00 and went to sleep 😴</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="tusday-2405">Tusday, 24/05<a class="hash-link" href="#tusday-2405" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We got up at 10, I'm a little early, relatively early to yesterday 🙃 and went out to eat breakfast. We bought breads, sausages and tomatoes and sat down to eat breakfast on a bench near the park.</p><p>Then we went to <strong>Aqua Dom</strong>, the sea world in Berlin. There we saw all kinds of very cool underwater fish and animals some of which we had not seen before. Was very interesting and fun but in our opinion it is a little Overrated attraction.</p><p>After the Aqua Dom we went to the <strong>TV Tower of Berlin</strong>. The TV tower reaches a peak of about 300 meters, and gives a different and very impressive way of looking at Berlin. There is also a restaurant at the top of the tower where we ate some starters, where the floor revolves and during the meal you can see the whole of Berlin.</p><p>We were not satisfied with the first courses in the tower so we went to eat small at McDonald's and from there we went back to the hotel.</p><p>In the evening we went out to do a tour of the city, we went to see the <strong>Brandenburg Gate</strong>, we ate, we went back to the hotel and now we go to sleep 🥱</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="wednesday-2505">Wednesday, 25/05<a class="hash-link" href="#wednesday-2505" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For breakfast we bought breads and sausages from the supermarket and sat down to eat in the park (yes we have done this several times already but it's fun what the problem is 🤨).</p><p>After breakfast we headed towards the <strong>Spree River</strong>. We went on a cruise that lasted about an hour along the river while giving detailed explanations of the various parts, buildings and cups we passed next to them in the city (to our surprise, the explanations could also be heard in Hebrew!). To me the cruise was a great experience that gave us another and different look at the city.</p><p>After the cruise we went to the <strong>Berlin Zoo</strong>. Wow, one of the big and diverse zoos that I (Ido) personally have been to. We have seen animals of all kinds and species and from all the continents and different countries around the world. We were there for more than 3 hours and saw almost the entire zoo (except the giraffe… 🦒). The main animals we had the most fun seeing were first of all the seals, which were very cute and funny; Secondly the panda bear, one of the cute animals I got to see and glad we got to see them so up close; And in addition the chimpanzees, who amazed us to see how similar they are to us both in appearance and in how they behave separately and with each other.</p><p>Time passed very quickly at the zoo (time passes quickly when you have fun…) and it was already 18:30 and we had not eaten anything since the sausage sandwich in the morning. We were very hungry. How when we left the zoo we saw a branch of Curry36 and that's exactly what suited us, it was great 👌🏻</p><p>After we finished eating we went to the <strong>Monkey bar</strong>. A bar located on the 10th floor of the building in front of the zoo, overlooking its large monkey cage (hence the name). We ordered two drinks and sat down to drink them in front of the spectacular view that can be seen at this height. It was a lot of fun there 🍻</p><p>After five days we are together 24/7, not everything is perfect and a little argument started between us. I went in to take a shower and when I left I realized that it was really stupid and that we should talk about it so that it would not ruin the rest of the trip for us, Omri wanted time alone and did not want to talk so much so everyone went to work. We wanted to go out to a club or a bar or something today but I think it will not happen today. Hopefully tomorrow will be different so we can take advantage of the time we have left in Berlin and not end up with such a disgusting feeling.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="thursday-2605">Thursday, 26/05<a class="hash-link" href="#thursday-2605" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A bit of a bad start to the day after yesterday. We started with breakfast in a cafe near the hotel and from there we continued to the <strong>Berlin Museum of Technology</strong>.</p><p>The museum was relatively large but not exactly an interactive technology museum as described on the various sites. he. What's more a historical museum of old technology, like planes, ships, jewelry making, trains, etc.? Overall it was cool but we expected more.</p><p>We then went to eat. We ate at <strong>Vapiano</strong> restaurant, an Italian restaurant that was cute (not like Italy… 🙃).</p><p>Next to the restaurant we went to the <strong>Futurium Museum</strong>, a museum that presents possible scenarios for the future, and shows solutions for sustainable energy sources. The museum was very cool and interactive, and showed us how much power technology has. I personally really liked the experience.</p><p>The museum is next to the Spree River, so after we finished at the museum we took 2 glasses of beer and sat on the river bank. It's just like a 'beach' where a lot of people sit and look at the landscape of Berlin. Was very cool.</p><p>Now we were already hungry so we went to look for the recommended restaurant <strong>Lili burger</strong>, every site we read recommended a rise. We started driving there but unfortunately there is another place called Lili and it is at the other end of town so we just drove half an hour to another place. After realizing the mistake we drove to the right place, but when we arrived the place was not where it was supposed to be. We searched the nearby streets but without success. At the end we asked a local couple and he told us that they closed the place some time ago and that it no longer exists. Bummer. But the couple directed us to another burger restaurant that is close to a place called <strong>Brgrs Brgrs</strong>. The burger was nice, not amazing, but enjoyed nonetheless.</p><p>After eating we drove to a very cool bar called <strong>Ice bar</strong>. The whole bar is made of ice (also the glasses) and the temperature is 20 degrees (when we left the bar we could not feel some of the fingers 😳😁). The place is very cool and there is a great deal of entry and 3 drinks each.</p><p>After the bar we arranged to go out with the guys we met a few days ago at the Kek bar. We went to the bar with them and what we did not know was that they were going to a gay bar. Ummm, yes. The place was not exactly for us, and the experience was not that pleasant, so we tried to get out of there as quickly as possible without offending the rest. One of the friends wanted to get us out of there because he saw we were not having so much fun, and take us to a party. But there was a holiday here that no one understood what it was, and because of it all the parties were closed.</p><p>In short, an interesting evening. We were at an ice bar, we accidentally got to a gay bar and in the end we did not go to the party as we wanted. But… experiences…</p><p>We went back to the hotel and went to bed around 3:00, in order to try to get up tomorrow as early as possible for the last day 🥺</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="friday-2705--saturday-2805">Friday, 27/05 + Saturday, 28/05<a class="hash-link" href="#friday-2705--saturday-2805" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Last day for a trip 🥺</p><p>We got up late… 🥱😐 and left the hotel at 11:30.</p><p>We stopped at the supermarket to buy breakfast, and from there we drove to the <strong>Illusions Museum</strong>, which was finally closed so we did not enter…</p><p>Except for the museum we wanted to do, this day was for shopping for clothes and gifts for friends and family.</p><p>We wandered around the different parts of the city in search of shops of the things we wanted. We went through Decathlon where we played Ping-Pong for almost an hour, at Vans store where Omri bought hats, at the C&amp;A store where Omri bought some shirts and I bought a cool hat. In short mostly we went around for shopping that day.</p><p>For lunch we drove to the recommended hamburger restaurant <strong>The bird</strong>. One of the most delicious burgers we have ever eaten! And along with a glass of beer everything was just great 🍻</p><p>The we were full and it made us tired, and because we also had a flight on which we left the hotel at 3:00 in the morning, we went back to the hotel to pack up and go to bed.</p><p>We got to the hotel, packed up, showered, and now go to bed until we get up for the flight. I will update when we get revenge 🙃</p><p>We got up at 3:15 and at 3:30 we were picked up by a taxi from the hotel. We arrived at the airport and were looking for something to eat, we were looking for McDonald's. Unfortunately neither McDonalds nor shoes, at the whole airport there was a single cafe with a half hour queue. But we were too hungry not to eat so we bought two sandwiches, coffee, chocolate and a croissant. Was reasonable. We then went to the gate of our flight, which was a 40 minute walk from us (🥵).</p><p>We arrived at the gate, got on the plane and now on our way to Israel 😁✈️</p>]]></content>
