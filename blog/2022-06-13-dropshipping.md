So I started dropshipping... üí∏

<!-- truncate -->

# Intro
For a long time now I wanted to start **making money online**, and have heard on many different ways people are making money online.  

One of the many ways that caught my attention was dropshipping, and I even tried it once when I was younger, but not very succesfully... üôÉ

So I decided to go at it again, and start **eBay dropshipping!**

# What is dropshipping?
Dropshipping is a business model were you act as a middleman between the customer and the supplier, and take a profit for this connection.

Only after you recive an order from the customer, you order the product from the supplier at a cheaper price, and send it to the customer.

Basically, you **buy low and sell high** (like every other business model) but without the need to hold you own stock.

You can start dropshipping with $0 and no risk, and make good money out of it.

# Starting out
I chose to start with eBay dropshipping.

I chose eBay because it's very easy to start compared to other ways (such as Shopify), and you already have a lot of customers looking to buy you stuff.

At the beginning I didn't know nothing, so I started to gather information. After watching a couple of YouTube videos, I had the knowledge to start my own eBay store.

At that point I had a **brand-new account** with **0 feedbacks**, **0 customers**, and just listed my **first item** üòÅ

# The first sell
At the beginning I was very skeptical about it.

Why would someone buy the stuff from me in a more expensive price rather than buy it from my supplier just like I do?

But after 1 day that my listing was up, **my first item had sold!**

I sold it for **$29.99** and made a profit of $0.58, yes **only 58 cents profit**, but it was enough for me to see the potential. 

I was super excited about it, and it gave me motivation to keep on going. Another thought that kept me motivated was to thinking about few years from now, and how much money I could possibly make if I will stay consistent.

# Progress
I've been dropshipping for the last 2 weeks now, and what I've learned is that all of the YouTubers that promiss you quick and easy money, are wrong...

In **2 weeks** I've sold **3 items** in total revenue of around **$200**, and not very high precentage profit.

I've also learned that one of the biggest problems about eBay dropshipping is the seller limits.  
Every month you have only so many items you can list or sell, and they are very restricting (you start with 3 items and $200).  
Getting the seller limits up is difficult because eBay won't allow you to do that very often (usually once a month), but with patient and consistency, once you get enough seller limits, you could make a lot of money.

# Conclusion
Dropshipping takes **time** and **effort**.

You can't expect quick results without putting the time and work needed.

But once you have the patient and the consistency, and you keep on going, I believe that you can achive **anything you want.**
